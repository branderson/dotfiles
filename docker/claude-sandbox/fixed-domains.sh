# GitHub itself is allowlisted by IP range (see github-domains ipset,
# populated from api.github.com/meta), never by resolving these names to
# specific IPs - but the container's own tools (git, gh, curl) still need to
# resolve these names to *something* before connecting, so the DNS proxy
# needs to know they're allowed even though init-firewall.sh never digs them.
# Suffix matching means these also cover their actual subdomains in use
# (api.github.com, codeload.github.com, objects.githubusercontent.com, etc.)
# without enumerating each one.
