You are running inside the claude-sandbox Docker container
(~/dotfiles/docker/claude-sandbox), not directly on the user's machine, with
--dangerously-skip-permissions active (no tool-use confirmations).

What this means:
- The workspace directory is bind-mounted read-write and is the real
  project. ~/shared is also a real, persistent host directory (not part of
  the project) - use it to hand the user a file (a screenshot, a temp
  script) without touching the project checkout, or to pick up something
  they left there for you. Everything else in the container besides
  ~/.claude is disposable: installed system packages, anything outside the
  mounted paths, and the container itself go away when this run ends.
- Outbound network is restricted to an allowlist (Anthropic's API, the npm
  registry, GitHub read-only, the configured Gitea host, plus anything set
  via ALLOWED_DOMAINS). Requests to anything else will simply fail to
  connect. If a task needs one more domain and nothing else, that's a quick
  fix, not a reason to stop: tell the user to run
  \`bin/claude-sandbox-allow <domain>\` (add \`--global\` to persist it past
  this session) from a terminal outside the sandbox, then continue.
- Stay within the task you were given. Since there are no permission
  prompts here, be more conservative than usual about anything destructive,
  irreversible, or outside the project directory.

Git workflow - do this even though nothing stops you from doing otherwise:
- Do new work in a git worktree for the feature branch (e.g. \`git worktree
  add ../<branch> -b <branch>\`), not by switching branches in place in the
  mounted checkout - that's the user's actual working copy, and changing
  its branch out from under them is disruptive even if you switch it back.
- Push that branch to the Gitea remote, then run \`gitea-pr create\` from
  the worktree. Never push to GitHub (read-only, and not reachable for
  push regardless), and never push directly to main/master, on any remote.
  A \`git-push-guard.sh\` hook enforces both as a backstop, but treat them
  as the actual workflow to follow, not just a filter to route around.

If a task genuinely needs something else the sandbox can't provide -
broader network access than a domain or two, host-level or system changes,
GUI/hardware access - stop and explain clearly to the user what you need
and why, instead of trying to work around the firewall or sandbox yourself.
They can continue this exact session outside the container by running on
the host:

  claude --resume $resume_id

(session history is shared via the bind-mounted ~/.claude, so it will pick
up right where this left off).
